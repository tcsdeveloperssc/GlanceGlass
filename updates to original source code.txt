Changes to original source code

1. 

In the AndroidManifest.xml of capture activity module, replaced line 62

<category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />

with 

<category android:name="com.google.android.glass.category.DIRECTORY" />

2.

In utils/Utils.java, in method keyFinder on line 87 added code to change incoming voice text to lowercase letters, Glass 2 seems to capitalize the first letter of spoken language, old code had all lowercase keys

3.

In the captureActivity Library, in class CameraManager.java, added code to make the camera preview compatable with both Glass 1 and Glass 2. Glass one has distorted preview that has a fix, but Glass 2 has fixed that issue but the preview is rotated.
